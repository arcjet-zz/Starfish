# Starfish
![Starfish logo](starfish.png)

[Starfish](https://www.particleincell.com/starfish) is a 2D (Cartesian or axisymmetric) code for simulating a wide range of plasma and gas problems.
It implements the electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (ES-PIC) method along with several fluid solvers. Material interactions are included through
MCC or DSMC collisions, or via chemical reactions. The computational domain can be divided into multiple rectilinear or body-fitted meshes, and linear/cubic
splines represent the surface geometry. The code can be easily extended with plugins. Starfish is written in Java and is actively being developed.

## Getting Started
Start by taking a look at a five-step 
[ES-PIC](https://www.particleincell.com/2012/starfish-tutorial-part1/) and [DSMC](https://www.particleincell.com/2017/starfish-tutorial-dsmc/) tutorials.
Input files for the tutorials are included in the dat directory. On the PIC-C website you will also find
a [PowerPoint presentation](dat/tutorial/starfish-code-overview.pdf) with some introductory remarks about the source code. The associated video is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFeT_X-IsU).

# Examples
Input files for these examples are located in the dat/ folder.

The external library binaries are excluded from the git repository in order to keep the git repo lightweight.

You can either get the binaries from this Google drive folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fb5bTQq19UHEZ3bOB8mkBd28iHnQNdr0?usp=sharing

Or you can generate them yourself, and then taking the contents of these folders (At least with VTK9):

## Windows:
VTK:
bin
lib\java\vtk-Windows-AMD64

## Linux:
VTK:
lib (files only, not the folders)
lib\java\vtk-Linux-x86_64

    <h1>Simulation File Builder</h1>
    <p>
        To run a Starfish simulation, you need to create a XML file in which you describe the details of the
        simulation and then load it into the Simulation Runner. This is a tool that generates the simulation XML file.
    </p>
    <h2>Structure of a Simulation File</h2>
    <p>
        Files consist of a sequence of commands which can either declare parameters or execute code. For example, the
        &lt;time&gt; command can be used to declare how many iterations the simulation will last and how many seconds
        each iteration is, and the &lt;starfish&gt; command will run the simulation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Generally, simulation files will follow this structure:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Declarations</li>
        <li>Running the simulation</li>
        <li>Output</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Part 1: Declarations</h3>
    <p>
        First, declare the parameters of the simulation. Generally, simulations will contain these commands:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The &lt;time&gt; command is used to state how many iterations the simulation will last and
            how many seconds will pass per iteration.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the &lt;domain&gt; command to choose which coordinate space the simulation uses, and nest
            &lt;mesh&gt; commands in it to create meshes.
        </li>
        <li>The &lt;material&gt; command defines types of materials and their physical characteristics.</li>
        <li>
            The &lt;boundary&gt; command creates geometric objects in the simulation. These objects can be used,
            for example, as physical barriers particles can interact with, or a region where particles will appear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the &lt;sources&gt; command to declare how particles are to be injected into the simulation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use these material interaction commands to define what happens when materials interact:
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;surface_hit&gt; for interactions between materials and a surface boundary.</li>
                <li>&lt;dmsc&gt;for interactions between two particles.</li>
                <li>&lt;mcc&gt; for interactions between a particle and a fluid.</li>
                <li>&lt;chemistry&gt; for interactions between two fluids.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These commands are parsed in order, so if you say a boundary X is made up of a material Y, the boundary
        command must come after the material command because the material has not been defined yet.</p>
    <h3>Part 2: Running the simulation</h3>
    <p>
        After setting everything up in part 1, use the &lt;starfish&gt; command and the simulation will run.
    </p>
    <h3>Part 3: Output</h3>
    <p>
       After the simulation has finished running, tell Starfish which field scalars, vectors, etc. to write to a file
        using the &lt;output&gt; command.
    </p>

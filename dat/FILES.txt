This folder contains input files for various examples.

** tutorial/: these are the inputs for the five step "flow around a sphere" tutorial described in more detail at https://www.particleincell.com/2012/starfish-tutorial-part1/

** examples/DSMC/jet: simulation of an atmospheric pressure jet expanding to a low pressure cavity

** examples/DSMC/diffusion: computation of the self-diffusion coefficient of Argon. This, and the above example are discussed in more detail at https://www.particleincell.com/2017/starfish-tutorial-dsmc/

** examples/multi-domain: example of a simulation utilizing multiple meshes. It simulates ions flowing through a sectioned tube. The middle section has a 1V potential on it, which prevents ions from passing, when the field solver is turned on

** papers/IEEEfullpic: a subset of simulation inputs used for the http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8287799/ paper
